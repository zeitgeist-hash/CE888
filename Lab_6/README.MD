**Task 6:** Apply Logistic Regression on training features and predict test features

## Lab 6: Exercise to be completed

Task 7: To complete this task, please create a new notebook in Google Colab. 

Your data is stored in Lab_6/Data folder. There are two .csv files: 1) Country-data.csv and 2) data-dictionary.csv. Please explore the data and use any clustering method to find the list of countries, which can categorised as follows:

| S.No      | Categories |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1   | under-developing country |
| 2   | developing country       |
| 3   | developed country        |
