1. Please go through VAEs [Exercise 1](https://github.com/sagihaider/CE888_2021/blob/main/Lab_9/Exercise_1_VAE.ipynb). I found a very interesting Blog Post on [VAEs](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/variational-autoencoders/) worth reading.

2. Please go through GANs [Exercise 1](https://github.com/sagihaider/CE888_2021/blob/main/Lab_9/Exercise_1_VAE.ipynb). If you are interested in reading more, I have created a GitHub repo two years ago [GANs Theory](https://github.com/sagihaider/GAN/blob/master/GAN_tutorial.ipynb) and [GANs MNIST Example](https://github.com/sagihaider/GAN/blob/master/DCGAN_MNIST.ipynb), please have a look.

### Task: 
No task this week, just try to understand both examples and complete your remaining labs.
